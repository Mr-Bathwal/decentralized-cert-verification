## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### New Functions Added

#### 1. `parseCSVFile(file)` - CSV Parser

```javascript
async function parseCSVFile(file) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = (e) => {
      const text = e.target.result;
      const lines = text.split("\n");
      const addresses = lines
        .map((line) => line.split(",")[0].trim())
        .filter((addr) => addr.length > 0 && addr !== "address");
      resolve(addresses);
    };
    reader.onerror = () => reject(new Error("Failed to read CSV file"));
    reader.readAsText(file);
  });
}
```

#### 2. `handleCSVUpload(e)` - File Upload Handler

- Validates file extension
- Sets CSV file state
- Shows error for invalid files

#### 3. Updated `handleBatchIssue(e)` - Smart Batch Processing
