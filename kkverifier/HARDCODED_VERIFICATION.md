# ✅ Hardcoded Verification Page - Always Shows Verified!

## 🎯 What Was Changed

The verify page now uses **hardcoded data** and **always shows as verified** when you click the Verify button. No blockchain or IPFS checks - just instant verification!

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Removed Blockchain Integration

- ❌ No more `useCertificate` hook
- ❌ No more blockchain fetching
- ❌ No more IPFS loading
- ❌ No more complex verification logic

### 2. Added Hardcoded Verification

```javascript
function handleSearch(e) {
  // Shows loading for 1.5 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Always returns VERIFIED status
    setCertificate({ ...hardcodedData, isValid: true });
    setVerificationResult({
      status: "verified",
      message: "Certificate is authentic and verified",
    });
  }, 1500);
}
```

### 3. Auto-Verify on Page Load

- If URL has certificate ID (e.g., `/verify/123`)
- Automatically triggers verification
- Shows verified status after 1.5 seconds

## 🎬 How It Works Now

1. **Enter Certificate ID** (any number/text)
2. **Click "Verify" button**
